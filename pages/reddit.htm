                    reddit is a website where content is prioritized based off of popularity. Users can “upvote” or “downvote” submissions and comments. The two types of submissions a user may create are links and text. A link submission can contain a url, image, or video.
                    Text submissions are similar to threads on a forum. Both types of submissions have a comments section where users can discuss the post. Nearly all of the content on the website is posted by its user base. The accounts of reddit’s users
                    are typically not meant to be associated with their real identity. Reddit can be thought of as a semi-anonymous social media network. reddit is partitioned into “subreddits” based on particular topics. These subreddits are created
                    and run by regular users. When a user first visits the site, they will see a feed of content composed of posts from all subscribed subreddits. If an unregistered user visits reddit, they will see content from what are known as the
                    default subreddits. Registered users can choose what content they see on their feed by subscribing and unsubscribing to different subreddits. Users can also visit a particular subreddit and exclusively examine their content. reddit
                    has a system where users can pay for “Coins” that they can use to give awards to particular posts or comments. Some of the awards can give the recipient “Reddit Premium” for a limited time. Reddit Premium gets rid of advertisements
                    on the site, allows the user to enter a special subreddit, and gives some other small benefits. Coins and Reddit Premium were created to allow users to financially support reddit in a fun way.

                    Two thirds of reddit’s users in the US are male. Two thirds of its users in the US are 18 to 29 years old. 70 percent of reddit’s users in the US are white [1]. Speaking from experience, most reddit users lean left politically, but there are also many
                    conservatives. A little over half of its users live in the United States. By order of magnitude, the rest of most of its users are from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Germany [1]. The majority of reddit’s users are young,
                    liberal, white, American men; this fact is often joked about among the website’s users.

                    Reddit provides its users a platform on which they may freely express themselves behind the safety of aliases. Posts and comments are judged by users based on votes; this gives users a means to promote or suppress content on the website. There are many
                    active, popular and niche subreddits; literally anyone could find a subreddit that would interest them. You can still get a lot out of reddit without making an account or participating.

                    The memes on reddit range from fresh to stale; it depends on where you look. Many new instances of memes appear throughout reddit every day. A lot of people go to reddit to find the memes that they will share with their real life friends through social
                    networks associated with their true identity. Some genres and species of memes surely made their debut on reddit. reddit had a sort of meme that involved a secret phrase that would allow reddit users to identify each other in public.
                    Saying, “The narwhal bacons at midnight,” would identify you as a reddit user [2]. This meme has since died and only veterans of the website now remember those strange times.
