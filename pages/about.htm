                    Spreadability is defined by Jenkins, Ford, and Green as “the potential – both technical and cultural – for audiences to share content for their own purposes, sometimes with the permission of rights holders, sometimes against their wishes.” (3), this concept
                    defines the popularization of the content before it is shared and spread. Content in different contexts and environments can each have a very different spreadability. Content on a popular social media page will have higher spreadability
                    then a picture in a text conversation between two people. It all depends on the circumstances of the content and what the content is made of that determine its spreadability. Simply put, Spreadability is the ability of content to spread.

                        There are two main factors at work when observing how spreadable content is, and they all require brief summaries on our understandings of each factor and how they contribute to spreadability.

                        <b>Audience Size</b> – When looking to have spreadable content it’s important to understand that the bigger the audience you have consuming your content, the more likely they are to share and continue to spread the content. Jenkins,
                        Ford, and Green compare the strategies of reaching these large audiences in their comparison of marketing’s “gather” versus “scatter”. (79) Marketing from companies try to use “influencers”, or people with a large following like
                        someone famous, to reach many people with content. These people are already gathered and probably won’t spread the content very much, this is the “gather” strategy. The “scatter” method involves building relationships with individuals
                        so they are highly to always share content presented to them from a respected source. (80) Having a large audience helps promote content to others outside of that specific audience, there’s always strength in numbers.

                        <b>Spreadable Characteristics</b> – When looking at content overtime it becomes clear that there are similar patterns found in highly spreadable material. These patterns boil down to simple characteristics of the content. Jenkins
                        provides the characteristics as rumors, unfinished, humor, shared fantasies, parody and references, mystery, timely controversy (195). These characteristics share similar reasons for their relevance in spreadable content, but they
                        are all a little different. Rumors appeal to our sense of wonder and our thirst for knowledge. When we find out something odd and unconfirmed we want to know if it’s true because its information we can’t have. Unfinished content
                        calls to action and allows people to participate in finishing the content. Humor is a basic positive emotion that everyone loves to feel so people spread this content to one another. Shared fantasies appeal to feelings we have
                        and gives us a sense of belonging that others feel the same. Parodies and references provide more entertainment out of previously consumed material. People who consumed the original content are free to discuss the new content while
                        reflecting on the old. Mystery is another characteristic that appeals to our sense of wonder and strive for knowledge. Timely controversy is spreadable due to the emotional and opinionated environment controversy presents. Given
                        that the controversy is timely and most people will have witnessed an aspect of it to be able to weigh in on this content.

                <div class="row">
                    <p>
                        To have your content reach a large audience you need to at least have an audience to start, and that audience you’re presenting your content to needs content with spreadable characteristics to feel the need to share the content with others. These two
                        simple aspects of spreadable content will greatly improve the spreadability of any content.

                    Memes are just another form of content that can utilizes these characteristics and environments to have more spreadability. Memes usually focus on the aspects of humor, parodies or references, and even timely controversy to appeal to audiences and become
                    spreadable content. Memes are a type of content can work well with any format of platform. There are video memes, picture memes, text memes, etc. The formats are forever changing because meme are also doing so. They can be used any
                    community to provide emotional feedback from online communities as they utilize them to communicate with one another. Memes are highly spreadable due to their ever-changing nature and overall appeal to emotion.
