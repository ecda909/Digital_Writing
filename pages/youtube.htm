                    The website Youtube was created in February 2005 by former PayPal employees as a video hosting service. The site grew into a successful hit as by December the website was garnering over eight million visits per day. This success caught the attention of
                    growing internet giant Google who would later purchase the website in November of 2006 for over 1.5 billion dollars. (bus insider) Within the near decade and a half of its existence, the service has grown where creators can make a
                    living through content creation by the means of advertisement revenue while companies can use the service to reach their audience through a new medium. With an Alexa rank of #2 globally, Youtube is without a doubt the largest video
                    viewing audience and with how big the community has spawned different types of sub communities based who viewers are subscribed too.

                    As mentioned before, there are different communities that revolve around content creators and they can overlap with their user base. Each user has the potential to be subscribed to different content creators and participate in that community. This in
                    turn can explain how memes across the platform spread or become popular as the audience of YouTube can be very active when it comes to sharing and spreading content from the site. In Henry Jenkin’s book, Spreadable Media, he talks
                    about how spectators or inactive users still have value as they are the majority of the users who interact with that content (Jenkins). Most of the views and likes off videos on Youtube come from this category of user and even though
                    they might not be the one directly sharing the link to the video, they are behind the traffic that gets videos to the front page and can garner more views.

                    The medium of memes on Youtube are unsurprisingly videos which isn’t just exclusive to just video with just images and audio. There is an argument that the website is just a place to host memes that are video and audio, but there are some that originated
                    on that site that spread to other channels. An example would be videos from foreign movies that the dialogue is not English so there is a subtitle track. Users would upload videos of scenes from certain movies that would feature an
                    edited English subtitle track that would turn an otherwise serious scene of drama into one of comedy. This fad would translate to screenshots of certain movies where people edit scenes that have subtitles and change subtle words to
                    change the meaning. A good example of this would be the German film, “Downfall” that features the end of WW2. A scene that features an angry reaction from Adolf Hitler that is deflated by the subtitles that show he is reacting about
                    his xbox account being banned. This is just one example of the many memes that encompass Youtube. </p>
