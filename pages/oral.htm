                    Memes have existed in the cultures of humanity, in some form, for thousands of years. The best place to look for the beginning of memes is ancient Greece. This is where western philosophy began, and where humanity made huge leaps in science and mathematics.
                    The great Aristotle came up with an idea we now call the enthymeme [1]. Aristotle said that enthymeme meant “the body of proof”. He also believed the enthymeme to be “the strongest of rhetorical proofs”. How enthymeme is defined today
                    is different from in the days of Aristotle.
                </p>

        </div>
        <div class="row justify-content-center chan-contentrow-1" id="middle">
            <div class="col-md-10">
                <p>
                    Enthymeme describes the phenomenon where saying one thing implies another thing, but another unstated implication comes to mind from hearing what was said [2]. For example, saying, “I go home at the end of the day,” and, “it’s the end of the day,” implies
                    the speaker is heading home. It’s sort of like making a pop culture reference. For example, you could make a quote from a movie to your friend and they would be reminded of the movie even though you didn’t explicitly introduce the
                    concept of that film into your friend’s mind in your quote. The Greeks didn’t have movies back then, but they had plays and music.

                    To share poetry and epic stories, a performance had to be made. The name used to refer to ancient Greek singers who would sing famous epics, like the Iliad and Odyssey, is Aoidos [3]. These epics were memorized by the Aoidos and performed live. The Greeks
                    would have recognized what was meant by their friend saying that some weakness is the Achille’s Heel of something. The mythos of their gods brought many memetical ideas to the minds of the Greeks. If they called someone a Narcissus,
                    they were comparing that person to the character whose downfall came from being too in love with himself. This is where we derived the term narcissist from.

            <div class="col-md-10">
                <p>
                    Some of the memetical ideas from ancient times have survived for thousands of years and still influence the way we think about things. Some ancient proto-memes have detached from their origin, like the previously mentioned word, narcissist. Narcissist
                    has a well-recognized definition that can be easily understood without hearing the story of Narcissus. If you look to the Abrahamic mythos, there is also the character Nimrod.

                <p>
                    Nimrod was a such a good hunter, he’s in holy books, so if you were compared to him, it meant you were dang good at hunting. Now, if a North American calls you a nimrod, they’re saying that you’re an idiot. This is thanks to the popular twentieth century
                    cartoon character Bugs Bunny [4]. He sarcastically called Elmer Fudd (the guy hunting for rabbits in the cartoon) Nimrod to mock him. Most viewers didn’t know about the character Nimrod and assumed it was a word used to describe a
                    moron because of the wit of a cartoon rabbit.
