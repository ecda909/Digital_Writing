                    Ever since the rise of the desktop PC and the Internet, we have been slowly entering the digital age. Once social media came about that slow crawl turned into a full-on sprint. At this point in time there is virtually nothing that can’t be done from a
                    computer, cell phone, tablet, watch, AI assistant, etc. Just as we have moved into a digital age so has the way that we communicate and share.

                    In the digital age memes thrive. There are memes about politics, weather events, celebrities and even grapes. Memes which have always been a part of human culture, make up a large part of the content that is being produced for social media. We mention
                    a few of the popular channels that are used to spread memes in the “Channels” section of the site. There are many forms of memes that exist. Traditional memes feature a picture of something with text or some sort of caption. As time
                    progressed so did popular meme formats. Now there are twitter formatted memes, memes that use videos or GIFs, and more. The popularity of memes in the digital age is thanks to the technologies that we have been afforded. Direct messaging,
                    retweeting, liking, texting, and commenting are some of the ways that a meme can gain popularity. Compared to the oral and print age, the spread of something such as memes can reach a much larger audience in such a short period of
                    time.

                    In November of 2018, the phrase “They did surgery on a grape” took the internet by storm. In 2010 a video was posted by Edward Hospital showcasing a new surgical system capable of peeling the skin off of a grape. In 2017 Cheddar shared a modified version
                    of the video that had the now popular phrase “They did surgery on a grape.” In November of 2018 a screen shot of the surgery grape video was posted on Instagram and it spread like wild fire from there. Numerous people were creating
                    memes based around the phrase. Some mocked the fact that surgery was done on a grape, having in mind that surgery is mostly done on humans. Others commented on just how far into the future we’ve come. The stickiness of this phenomenon
                    could be broken down according to the six principles of Chip and Dan Heath from their book Made to Stick.
