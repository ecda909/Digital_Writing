                    The medium of print has been around for centuries and with the inception of the digital age, has taken a step back from being the main form of communication. Since its creation, there have been many evolutions of the medium in regards to memes. The first
                    memes through print could be described as jokes through text or stories written of a humorous nature. This is just one aspect of the different forms of memes that embodied print and new forms would come to be as the medium grew older.
                    It wasn’t until the early 20th century where one of prints biggest vehicles emerged through the means of comic strips. Appearing in newspapers, some of the earliest comic strips showcased amusing and comical short stories in around
                    three panels. These comics were illustrated and then printed in newspapers across the country as well as the globe as their popularity grew with how simplistic they could embellish. Moving forward some stories would get so popular
                    they would branch off into their own genre of entertainment like comic books and other forms of print memes would come and go with how people received them. Other forms like magazines that specialize in comedy like Mad or National
                    Lampoon would come as their own around the late 60s and 70s. These forms that embodied the medium of print would last even through the inception of the digital age, even though their interest is declining. Charatersitics of print memes
                    still exist today through digital by means text jokes like greentext stories from 4chan and copypastas from reddit.

                    Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot.
                    Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbor’s dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds
                    two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up.
                    Just as the founding fathers intended. </p>
