                    Facebook was created February 4th, 2004 by a man named Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook was created around the time of earlier social media platTools to connect students at various schools, then as of 2006 anyone who registered over the age of 13. Tracii Ryan
                    of the Journal of Behavioral Addictions notes that, “statistics provided by Facebook (2014) reveal that as of March 2014 there were 1.28 billion active users on the site per month, and at least 802 million of these users logged into
                    Facebook every day. With statistics such as these, it is not surprising that Facebook is the most popular SNS in the world.” This platform focuses on connecting others together as friends and for events, but has also provided was to
                    post material for others to consume on your Facebook page. This has cause Facebook to be a channel of sharing content rather than creating content like memes

                    Facebook as a platform focuses on community and being interconnected with others you know. This social media has had one of most prominent and has been around longer than most of current platTools. This combination of longevity and prominence online has
                    been forming Facebook into a simple media that any user can easily comprehend and utilize. Facebook simplistic nature has been helping demographics that struggle with newer technologies like the older crowds. Ryan states, “most popular
                    motives for Facebook use are relationship maintenance, passing time, entertainment, and companionship.” These communicative and interactive motives allow memes to circulate between users as they share them with one another. This older
                    demographic representing the average user has caused Facebook to be the social media full of users that are behind on the times and aren’t constantly active in the newer content as they try to catch up and understand content provided
                    by other platTools. Facebook’s audience primarily consumes older meme content and news stories rather than creating its own or keeping up with modern trends in meme culture.

                    Facebook consisting of older users uses older meme formats that existed around the time Facebook was commonly used by younger users. Some of the first memes were created by using a simple picture that commentary could be produced about, followed by text
                    in impacting fonts on the top and bottom of the image in question. This meme was popular around the beginning of meme usage in the digital age and examples of this basic format can be found on the home page. Facebook primarily focuses
                    on pictures and talking with one another, which is why this basic format took off. Other than the basic format, videos will be circulated from other channels for content like YouTube. Facebook’s creation of memes has decline as they
                    have focused on the communication aspect of the media with their app “Facebook Messenger”, and the platform has become more a channel for memes to pass through in conversation with others on the platform.
